# Windows Vagrant Ansible Docker Experiment

This is a personal experiment to get a full dev environment working on local windows machine, 
using **Vagrant + Ansible + Docker**, with the hope that eventually everything done here will 
allow for a quick and complete development environment setup **on any OS** including:
- server deployment
- network configuration with port redirection
- user access setup
- git integration
